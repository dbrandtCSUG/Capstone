# Capstone
This repository contains files pertaining to my Masters in Data Analytics Capstone Project
at Colorado State University Global.

The project is 'Impact of Weather on Ridership of the Chicago Transit Authority'

* Transit ridership data was acquired from the online Chicago Data Portal
* Weather data was acquired from the online data portal of the National Centers for Environmental Information, specifically for weather station ID USW00094846 (Chicago O’Hare International Airport) 
* The two sets of data were blended into a single dataset used in the project using Microsoft Power Query (via Power BI)
* The dataset used in the analysis reflects the time period of January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2019
* SAS® Studio was used for the analysis
